1. Introduction
----------------

After countless hours and years of hard work, the third episode of Doom 3: Phobos is finally complete. We are very pleased with how it turned out, and hope you will be too.

----------------
2. Installation
----------------

2.1. Prerequisites

Latest version of Doom 3 and latest version of Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil. Doom 3: Phobos does not work with Doom 3: BFG Edition or any NON-Windows version of Doom 3 and Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil.

Doom 3: Phobos does not support Linux or macOS versions of Doom 3.

Dhewm3 or any other port does not support Doom 3: Phobos. Play Doom 3: Phobos with vanilla Doom 3 and Doom 3: RoE.

2.2. Installation

Unpak the folder named ‘tfphobos’ into the root of your Doom 3 installation folder. If you have Episode 2 installed make sure to overwrite all files. Do not rename the folder.

You can not start Doom 3: Phobos through the Doom 3 or Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil mod list in the menu.

You need to create a shortcut with ‘Target’ Eg: "[Doom3Dir]\DOOM3.exe" +set fs_game tfphobos +set fs_game_base d3xp.

Or place the Phobos.bat file in the root folder of Doom 3 and run that.

If you own Doom 3 and Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil, through steam you can also set +set fs_game tfphobos +set fs_game_base d3xp under the Doom 3 properties via the Steam client. Doom 3 and Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil are now part of Doom 3: BFG Edition on Steam.

We do not guarantee the original campaign or multiplayer in Doom 3 or Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil to work with Doom 3: Phobos. Neither do we guarantee any additional mods you install on your own, will work with Doom 3: Phobos.

If you experience any problems, please try and have Doom 3: Phobos installed on a fresh copy of Doom 3 and Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil, with no other mods installed.

There is no CD-KEY window in Doom 3: Phobos. If you are playing Doom 3: Phobos with a fresh install of Doom 3 you need to start up Doom 3 without Doom 3: Phobos, and insert your CD-KEY.

For AMD users experiencing any problems (Thanks to Stradex and Anton for telling us):
1. Create a copy of doom3.exe called phobos.exe
2. Edit the .bat file to use Phobos.exe

If you still encounter problems:
3. Disable bloom

If you have any graphic issues try this:
https://www.moddb.com/games/doom-iii/addons/doom-3-phobos-bad-quality-fix-cfg

If the sound has too much reverberation, make sure you have EAX 4.0 HD turned off.

4. Difficulty
----------------

We have designed the game to be played on ‘Hurt Me Plenty’, but if you want an even bigger challenge any difficulty above is playable.

‘Nightmare’ is a different kind of beast. And we’ve made some changes to reflect that. Your health no longer slowly drains, you don’t have the soul cube and health packs are back.
